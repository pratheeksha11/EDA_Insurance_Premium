# Health Insurance Cost Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Insights & Conclusion

### Data Overview
The dataset analyzed in this project comprises 1337 unique entries post-cleaning. It encapsulates several features that include age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

### Data Distribution
- The age and BMI of beneficiaries are fairly normally distributed.
- The majority of beneficiaries have 0 to 1 children.
- Insurance charges are right-skewed with a few outliers pointing to very high medical costs.

### Statistical Analysis
- There is a statistically significant difference in insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers, with smokers incurring notably higher costs.

### Predictive Modeling
- **Linear Regression** served as our baseline model, achieving an \( R^2 \) score of 0.7513.
- **Ridge Regression** indicated a slight improvement over the baseline, hinting at the presence of multicollinearity among predictors.
- **Random Forest Regression** markedly outperformed the linear models, with an \( R^2 \) score of 0.8346, suggesting the data harbors complex, non-linear relationships.

### Key Observations
- **Smoking Status**: Emerged as a pivotal factor in predicting charges, aligning with the industry practice of levying higher premiums on smokers due to increased health risks.
- **Age and BMI**: Displayed positive correlations with insurance charges.
- **Sex and Region**: Appeared to have a lesser impact on the prediction of insurance charges.
