## Overview
This project encompasses a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of health insurance costs using a dataset of insurance beneficiaries. The goal is to identify factors that influence medical costs billed by health insurance and to develop predictive models to estimate these costs.

## Data
The dataset includes the following features:
- Age of the beneficiary
- Sex of the beneficiary
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of children/dependents
- Smoking status
- Region of residence in the US
- Charges (medical costs)

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured approach:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization
3. Correlation Analysis
4. Hypothesis Testing
5. Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regression

## Key Findings
- Smoker status is the most significant predictor of higher insurance costs.
- Age and BMI also influence costs, though to a lesser extent.
- The developed Random Forest model explains approximately 83.46% of the variability in insurance charges.

## Running the Code
The analysis is presented in a Kaggle Notebook format. To run the code visit [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pratheekshanath/eda-insurance-premium-code/notebook)
